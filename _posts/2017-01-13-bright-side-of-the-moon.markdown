Quick Update: I have a flat! My German was barely enough to make it. Und
zwar komisch. You get a flat on your birthday. Hard to say how it could
get any fucking better than that.

Oh: Ev buldum lan. Na aşağıdaki! #direnkigülsünyüzün.

Last and least. Here is a poem and a song that describes everything so far.
Life. is. just. pregnant.

Çağırın! Güneşin zaptı yakın! #martılaraselam #petşişeistemezük.
