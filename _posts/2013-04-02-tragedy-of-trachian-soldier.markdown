Here is a brief attempt to translate the nervous breakdown of a Trachian soldier
after 6 hours of sentry-duty... As a show of respect to the soldier, the f-word
has been substituted with the word **love** on all occurences.

That's it, love it! That's it, love it!  
I've had enough of this duty!  
I've been here for 6 hours, love it!  
Love who put me here, love who made him put me here! Love 'em all!  
Lovers trusting me to secure this huge company!  
What is this? That tears it! Love it!  
What is this? Love it!  
What is this? Am I an animal? Love it!  
Are my parents cows?!!  
No more of this loving duty!  
No more I am no part of it! Love it!  
**Cameraman**: Yeah, lie down, chill!  
What is this? Who the love does he think he is? Love him too!  
**Cameraman**: Enough already!
